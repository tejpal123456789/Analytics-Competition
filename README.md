# Analytics-Competition


I have provided analytics_competition.ipynb file , this file contains all the training and testing code. run.ipynb file contains code which give output on two images like if we provide path of two images this code will tell us whether these two images are similar or not.

I have submitted .h5 and pickle image encoding file in the drive because due to big size github is not accepting(more than 25 MB).
